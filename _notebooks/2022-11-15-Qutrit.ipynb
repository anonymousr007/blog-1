This implies that the right-hand side in eq.\\eqref{XZX} needs to have at least three parameters and hence three elementary rotations. Good, this explains why are there three terms in Euler's decomposition. (This technique of unsubtle parameter counting in fact extends far more generally. For example, it can be used to deduce a minimum amount of $CNOT$ gates necessary to compile an arbitrary $n$-qubit unitary, as I discussed [here](https://idnm.github.io/blog/machine%20learning/compilation/qiskit/paper%20review/2021/07/22/Machine-learning-compilation-of-quantum-circuits.html#Theoretical-lower-bound-and-quantum-Shannon-decomposition)).\n",

    "\n",
    "However, decompositions like $XZX$ are special in a sense that they are examples of Cartan (aka KAK) decompositions, hinging on the structure of the underlying $su(2)$ algebra. Decompositions of two-qubit gates into $CNOT$ gates and single-qubit rotations is another important example where KAK arise. I will not cover the subject here, but can recommend a quite readable introduction with applications to quantum gates [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010100](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0010100).\n",
