    "\n",
    "The difference between \\eqref{bell} and \\eqref{unen} is that all latter states are actually products of the form $|\\psi_1\\rangle |\\psi_2\\rangle$ while the state \\eqref{bell} **can not** be represented in such form. You can *define* entangled states by this property of not being factorizible into wavefunctions of consistuent spins.\n",
    "\n",
    "A perfectly reasonable question to ask is \"so what\"? Why are entangled states special? Personally I was aware of this formal aspect of entanglement for years, but I only asked the latter pragmatic question when exposed to quantum computations. Answers one can give to this \"so what\" question are numerous and most of them very interesting. I will only consider two.\n",
