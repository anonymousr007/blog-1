<p>The <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages#setup-instructions">official installation</a> worked fine for me. While customizing the blog fro my purposes several issues were not obvious</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted to use number equations which are not easily supported. This <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/consider-setting-use-math-to-true-by-default/64276/6">comment</a> solved my problem!</li>
<li>You need to edit <code>_pages/about.md</code> to customize the way your "about" page is displayed.</li>
<li>To customize the front page you need to edit <code>index.html</code>. This is literally written on the front page of your blog, but I have not noticed it for a while.</li>
<li>Initially a lot of troubleshooting is needed to get the appearance of the blog I wanted. Commiting and waiting for the online web page to set up is slowing this down. Here is an <a href="https://github.com/fastai/fastpages/blob/master/_fastpages_docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#converting-the-pages-locally">official guide</a> on how to setup a live preview of your blog locally. One minor point that was a problem for me is that the default server  <a href="https://127.0.0.1:4000">https://127.0.0.1:4000</a> was not correct. After running <code>sudo make server</code> one of the outputs that <code>jekyll</code> produces is <code>Server address:</code> <a href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/blog/">http://0.0.0.0:4000/blog/</a> which was the correct address for the live preview of my blog.</li>
</ol>
