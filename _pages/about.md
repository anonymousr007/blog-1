My name is [Nikita Nemkov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikita-nemkov/), I am a theoretical physicist diving into the field of quantum computation. On this blog I consolidate some of my thoughts on the subject, from reviews of the basic concepts to brief reports on the newest research papers.

I do not expect to have many readers and I do not tailor my posts to any particular audience. Perhaps the reader that could benefit from these notes the most is me, before writing them. Yet, if you found anything that I wrote useful give me a quick feedback in the comments or drop an [email](../images/email.jpg)!
